\title{2.3: Plots for group sequential designs}
\description{The \code{plot()} function has been extended to work with objects returned by \code{gsDesign()} and \code{gsProbability()}. 
For objects of type \code{gsDesign}, seven types of plots are provided: z-values at boundaries (default), power, 
estimated treatment effects at boundaries, 
conditional power at boundaries, spending functions, expected sample size, and B-values at boundaries.
For objects of type \code{gsProbability} plots are available for z-values at boundaries, power (default), estimated treatment effects at boundaries, conditional power, expected sample size and B-values at boundaries.
}

\usage{
plot.gsProbability(x, plottype=2, base=FALSE, ...)
plot.gsDesign(x, plottype=1, base=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{Object of class \code{gsDesign} for \code{plot.gsDesign()} or \code{gsProbability} for 

\code{plot.gsProbability()}.}
	\item{plottype}{1=boundary plot (default for \code{gsDesign}),
 
	2=power plot (default for \code{gsProbability}), 

	3=estimated treatment effect at boundaries, 

	4=conditional power at boundaries, 

	5=spending function plot 
	(only available if \code{class(x)=="gsDesign"}), 

	6=expected sample size plot, and 

	7=B-values at boundaries. 

	Character values for \code{plottype} may also be entered: \code{"Z"} for plot
type 1,
\code{"power"} for plot type 2, \code{"thetahat"} for plot type 3,
	\code{"CP"} for plot type 4, \code{"sf"} for plot type 5, \code{"ASN"}, 
\code{"N"} or \code{"n"} for plot type 6, and \code{"B"}, \code{"B-val"} or 
\code{"B-value"} for plot type 7.}
	\item{base}{Default is FALSE, which means ggplot2 graphics are used. If true, base graphics are used for plotting.}
	\item{...}{This allows many optional arguments that are standard when calling \code{plot}.

	Other arguments include: 

\code{theta} which is used for \code{plottype=2}, \code{4}, \code{6}; normally defaults will be adequate; see details. 

\code{ses=TRUE} which applies only when \code{plottype=3} and 

\code{class(x)=="gsDesign"}; indicates that estimated standardized effect size
	at the boundary is to be plotted rather than the actual estimate.

\code{xval="Default"} which is only effective when \code{plottype=2} or \code{6}. Appropriately scaled (reparameterized) values for x-axis for power and expected sample size graphs; see details.}
}

\value{An object of \code{class(x)}; in many cases this is the input value of \code{x}, while in others \code{x$theta} is replaced 
and corresponding characteristics computed; see details.}

\details{
The intent is that many standard \code{plot()} parameters will function as expected; exceptions to this rule exist.
In particular, \code{main, xlab, ylab, lty, col, lwd, type, pch, cex} have been tested and work for most values of \code{plottype}; one
exception is that \code{type="l"} cannot be overridden when \code{plottype=2}. Default values for labels depend on \code{plottype} and 
the class of \code{x}.

Note that there is some special behavior for values plotted and returned 
for power and expected sample size (ASN) plots for a \code{gsDesign} object.
A call to \code{x<-gsDesign()} produces power and expected sample size for only two \code{theta} values: 0 and \code{x$delta}. 
The call \code{plot(x, plottype="Power")} (or \code{plot(x,plottype="ASN"}) for a \code{gsDesign} object produces power (expected sample size) curves and returns a \code{gsDesign} object with \code{theta} values determined as follows. 
If \code{theta} is non-null on input, the input value(s) are used.
Otherwise, for a \code{gsProbability} object, the \code{theta} values from that object are used.
For a \code{gsDesign} object where \code{theta} is input as \code{NULL} (the default), \code{theta=seq(0,2,.05)*x$delta}) is used. 
For a \code{gsDesign} object, the x-axis values are rescaled to \code{theta/x$delta} and the label for the x-axis \eqn{theta / delta}.
For a \code{gsProbability} object, the values of \code{theta} are plotted and are labeled as \eqn{theta}.
See examples below.

Estimated treatment effects at boundaries are computed dividing the Z-values at the boundaries by the square root of \code{n.I} at that analysis. 

Spending functions are plotted for a continuous set of values from 0 to 1. 
This option should not be used if a boundary is used or a pointwise spending function is used
(\code{sfu} or \code{sfl="WT", "OF", "Pocock"} or \code{sfPoints}). 

Conditional power is computed using the function \code{gsBoundCP()}. 
The default input for this routine is \code{theta="thetahat"} which will compute the conditional power at each bound using the estimated treatment effect at that bound. 
Otherwise, if the input is \code{gsDesign} object conditional power is computed assuming \code{theta=x$delta}, the original effect size for which the trial was planned.

Average sample number/expected sample size is computed using \code{n.I} at each analysis times the probability of crossing a boundary at that analysis.
If no boundary is crossed at any analysis, this is counted as stopping at the final analysis.

B-values are Z-values multiplied by \code{sqrt(t)=sqrt(x$n.I/x$n.I[x$k])}. 
Thus, the expected value of a B-value at an analysis is the true value of 
\eqn{theta} multiplied by the proportion of total planned observations at that time.
